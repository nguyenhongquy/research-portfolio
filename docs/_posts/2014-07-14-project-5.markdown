description: In this project, we addressed the challenge of part-of-speech tagging for unknown words in Mandarin Chineseâ€”a language with minimal inflection and highly ambiguous affixes. We implemented a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model enriched with a set of morphological features inspired by Tseng et al. (2005) and extended with additional name patterns, affixation markers, and data from external corpora. Our experiments showed that these features significantly improve tagging accuracy, especially for unknown tokens. The results highlight the value of morphological cues and cross-corpus knowledge in improving the robustness of POS taggers for Chinese.
