description: In this project, I built a graph-based dependency parser using Eisnerâ€™s algorithm and an Averaged Perceptron model. By combining efficient decoding with a rich feature set, the parser achieves strong performance on English and German datasets. This work showcases a simple yet effective approach to syntactic parsing with solid cross-linguistic generalization.
