description: In this project, we explored sentence-final particles (SFPs)—a key grammatical feature of spoken Cantonese—by extracting and analyzing them from the Hong Kong Cantonese Corpus (HKCanCor). Using the PyCantonese Python library, we retrieved relevant utterances tagged with SFPs, stored the data in a structured MySQL database, and performed SQL-based linguistic queries. To enhance accessibility, we transformed query results into XML and HTML formats using XSLT. This workflow enabled detailed exploration of SFP distribution, combinations, and discourse functions, providing valuable insights into the syntactic and pragmatic roles of these expressive elements in Cantonese speech.
