description: This project explores how GPT-4o can be applied to enhance translation quality assurance in enterprise settings. It introduces a scalable, reference-less evaluation framework that detects, explains, and corrects translation errors in a human-like manner. By combining advanced prompting strategies with domain-aware retrieval, the system delivers explainable and actionable feedback suitable for integration into professional translation workflows. The reimplementation leverages open-source LLMs and will soon be released to support research and development in the field of AI-driven translation evaluation.
