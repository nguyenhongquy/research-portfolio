# Quy Nguyen

**Computational Linguist \| NLP Researcher \| Multilingual Technologist**

Welcome! I'm Quy Nguyen, a computational linguist with a strong background in linguistics and AI, currently focused on applying large language models (LLMs) to translation quality evaluation and multilingual NLP.

With a PhD in Linguistics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong and an MSc in Computational Linguistics from the University of Stuttgart, I bring a unique blend of theoretical and technical expertise. My experience spans academia and industry, most recently at Mercedes-Benz, where I developed explainable LLM-based solutions for translation review and terminology management.
